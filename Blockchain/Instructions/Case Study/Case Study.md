## Things to Keep in Mind for a Case Study
The key features of Blockchain Technology including decentralized, cryptographically secure, immutable and consensus-driven capabilities allow BlockchainMind to sell their consulting and advisory services to potential clients. For example, the decentralized and cryptographically secure nature of blockchain can deliver more transparent transaction management systems in a faster and more secure manner. It is believed that the integration of blockchain and 5G technology will reshape the traditional business.

A rough assumption of BlockchainMind's potential business revenue: as of June 2020, a total of 487,909 businesses with employees in Ontario were operating. Assuming BlockchainMind can sign the contracts with 10% of these businesses at an average selling price of 2,000 Cad, the business revenue is expected to reach 97 mm. Thus, the business potential behind such digital transformation is appealing, where we should keep monitoring.
